## Welcome

This is where I will post what I am working on in GitHub.

# Climate Data Resource!
I want to share a resource with you: [National Climatic Data Center - NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)
In the *"How may we assist you?"* window, you can search for data at a particular location (i.e. daily weather summaries from all stations in the state of Nevada for the entire period of record).

This data could be applied to study changes in climate from local to national scales. For example, how does the continuity  or intermittency of rainfall vary spatially across the US? Gather precipitation data at two different time scales (such as daily AND hourly or hourly AND sub-hourly) and compare the continuity of precipitation across sites. 

# Data Science Resource!
I want to share a resource for burgeoning programmers and data scientists: [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) 

ggplot 2 (*gg = the grammar of graphics*) is an extremely useful package for highly customizable data visualization in R and can be used to create a variety of different types of graphs and plots for representing your data and data analysis. 

The author, Hadley Wickham, is the Chief Scientist at RStudio and he is associated with University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University as an Adjunct Professor of Statistics. 

I'm interested in this book because although I use ggplot 2 to visualize data almost daily, the package has so many capabilities I have yet to take advantage of, and I usually end up searching on the internet to learn how to do only what I am trying to accomplish as opposed to taking the time to learn all that is possible with this tool.
